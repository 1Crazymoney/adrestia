# Conference Guidelines

Team members are encouraged to present talks about our software to local meetup
groups and at conferences.

When attending such events, you must disclose your affiliation with IOHK as an
employee, if it's relevant.

You are representing our group, your actions and words speak for us. So please
either speak in a way which reflects well on our group, or don't speak at all.

Don't create false expectations from the community. Never provide financial
advice or infomation about project schedules.

You may wish to help us promote the company as an employer for talented and good
people, but this isn't required.

With our software, copyright belongs to IOHK but you're the author, so do
celebrate your contributions.

Please acknowledge that IOHK has funded the open source software which you are
talking about.
