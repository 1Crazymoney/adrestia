# Passwords

Any passwords required for CI (e.g. API keys) or team accounts (e.g. Hackage)
should be stored in a secure place accessible to the whole team.

For this purpose, we have [Vaultwarden][]. Look in the
[Adrestia](https://vaultwarden.iog.io/#/vault?collectionId=de029761-b704-40c7-a106-105cde4b5a35)
collection under the
[IO Global](https://vaultwarden.iog.io/#/organizations/3bbffbd9-f0f8-4fb7-9d18-cca627081df0/vault)
organisation.

## Tips

1. Promptly accept your e-mail invitation to register an account under [IOG Vaultwarden][Vaultwarden]. The invitations expire fairly quickly.

2. You can use the [Bitwarden browser extension](https://bitwarden.com/browser-start/) with [Vaultwarden][]. Find the extension's Options menu and then set a custom base URL.
