## Shared passwords

Any passwords required for CI or accessing team accounts
(e.g. Hackage) should be stored in LastPass.

There is a `Shared-Adrestia` folder for this purpose, and everyone
should have access. Remember to accept the sharing request that was
sent to your e-mail address.

### TODO: Vaultwarden

- [ ] Replace LastPass with [Vaultwarden](https://vaultwarden.iog.io/)
