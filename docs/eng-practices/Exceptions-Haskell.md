# Exceptions in Haskell

In `cardano-wallet`, we currently use the following conventions for
dealing with exceptions.

## Avoid partial functions.

 Considering all corner cases does catch bugs.

**Example**: Do not use `head`, but use a pattern match, or consider using functions from `Safe` module, such as `headMay`.

**Example**: From the `Data.Text.Encoding` module, Use `decodeUtf8'` rather than `decodeUtf8` when handling user-supplied data. The latter function is partial and will crash your program if it receives non-UTF-8 input.


## Pure code vs `IO` actions

 * In pure code, use `error` instead of `undefined` if really necessary. In this case, please also add a `HasCallStack` constraint so that a backtrace can be shown when the impossible happens.

 * In `IO`, use `throwIO` to throw a regular exception.


## Asynchronous exceptions â€” never catch them

The purpose of asynchronous exceptions is to terminate the current thread. Use `bracket` or `finally` to quickly release resources if necessary.

Exception catching functions from `UnliftIO` are typically designed to only catch synchronous exceptions, which is what you want most of the time.

Therefore, import exception utilities from `UnliftIO.Exception` module rather than `Control.Exception`; these utilities have better default behavior for asynchronous exceptions.


## Use the tracing framework

If you desire to log an exception, use the tracing framework.


## Be specific when catching exceptions

For example, if you only want to catch errors when reading a file which doesn't exist use `tryJust`, `ioeGetErrorType`, `isDoesNotExistErrorType`, etc.


## Portability

Be aware that `IOException`s can have different forms on different platforms, especially with Windows and networking code. You need to test your exception handling on Windows.


## Checked vs. unchecked exceptions

 * Please do not mix `IO (Either e a)` or `ExceptT e IO a` with unchecked exceptions.

 * If using checked exceptions, do not add an `Exception` instance to your error type, because this will ensure that it cannot be thrown as an unchecked exception.

### Guidelines

Guidelines on the question of checked vs. unchecked exceptions are in progress.


## Callbacks

When using callbacks that involve monad transformers over `IO`, consider `MonadUnliftIO`.
