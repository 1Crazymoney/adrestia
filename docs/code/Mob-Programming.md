# Mob Programming

Pair programming is the act of coding together with someone else and
_Mob programming_ is the act of coding with one or more team members.

These aren't always the best way to develop, but they can potentially
help with speed, quality, and knowledge sharing.

Also, mob development can be a rewarding social activity, and is a
break from the usual solitary nature of our work.

## Server

We have a development server hosted on Google Compute Engine
specifically for the purposes of mob development.

Log in to the shared account using your ssh key and then start `tmux`.

```console
$ ssh adrestia@adrestia.iohkdev.io
```
