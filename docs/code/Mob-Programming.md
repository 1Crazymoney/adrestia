# Mob Development

[Mob development][mob-dev], or pair programming, is the act of coding together
with someone else.

It is not always the best way to do development, but it can help with
speed, quality, and knowledge sharing.

Also, mob development can be a rewarding social activity, and is a
break from the usual solitary nature of our work.

## Server

We have a development server hosted on Google Compute Engine
specifically for the purposes of mob development.

```console
$ ssh adrestia@adrestia.iohkdev.io
```


[mob-dev]: fixme
