# Co-Pilot Process

User stories are assigned to and owned by a single member of the team (a.k.a the
_Pilot_), and seconded by a _Co-Pilot_.

The roles work as follows:

| Mission | Role |

| Clarify product requirements as needed with the product owner(s) | Pilot |
| Break U/S into tasks (small, sizeable, chunks of work) | Pilot |
| Estimate U/S in terms of # of weeks | Pilot |
| Implement each task of a U/S | Pilot |
| Challenge the task division and review it | Co-Pilot |
| Primary reviewer of the development tasks | Co-Pilot |
| Call for assistance from peers when needed | Co-Pilot |
| Challenge implementation decisions and technical choices | Co-Pilot |
