This directory contains reference templates for Git repos.

Don't delete these, because other repos' CI (e.g. [cardano-addresses][]) points
to them.

List the templates with `tree -a` or `git ls-files`, so that you can also see
dotfiles which would normally be hidden from directory listings.

## GitHub templates

For reference GitHub templates, e.g. PR and issue templates, see
