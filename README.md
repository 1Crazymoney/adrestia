# Adrestia

Adrestia is a product team working on developing tooling and client interfaces
around Cardano. Our mission is to create an easier bridge between end-users
applications and Cardano core node by pushing out higher level interfaces to
interact with the Cardano blockchain.

This repository acts as a catalog of projects that fall under the scope of
Adrestia. The [wiki](https://github.com/input-output-hk/adrestia.wiki) summarizes also
the project's development practices and workflow.
