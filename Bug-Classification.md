Our software defects are tracked with Jira issues. Here is [the list of unresolved bugs](https://jira.iohk.io/issues?jql=project%3DADP%20and%20type%20%3D%20Bug%20and%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC%2C%20created) in the Adrestia project.

We classify bugs by two criteria, which are related but not exactly
the same thing.

### 1. Severity

Indicates the impact on users and how much functionality is affected. The severity is assessed by the engineering and QA team working on the system.

The Jira issue `Severity / Probability Score` field show how bad the defect is.

Severity | Description / Example
--- |     ---
1 | A core function of the system isn't responsive or is returning invalid data.
2 | Visible impact on a core function or significant performance degradation.
3 | Small defects that do not prevent any crucial functionality from working. Could some uninformative error or some bearable performance degradation. 
4 | Defect that wonâ€™t result in any noticeable disruption of the system, e.g. typo in a message.


### 2. Priority

Priority defines which issues should be addressed first.

The priority value is set by the product team based on business
requirements, the severity of the defect, estimated time to fix it,
and other factors such as impact on the user experience.

High severity defects will tend to have a higher priority, but this is
not necessarily always the case.

Priority | Description / Example
--- | --- 
Highest | Requires immediate attention. Critical issue that needs to be fixed ASAP and released as hotfix.
High | Needs to be addressed as soon as possible, probably within current sprint.
Medium | A bug that needs to be addressed after ongoing stories and tasks. For instance can be planned for next sprint.
Low | Would eventually require attention if time allows it.
